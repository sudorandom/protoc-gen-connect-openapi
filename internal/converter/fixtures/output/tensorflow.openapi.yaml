        The canonical error codes for TensorFlow APIs.

         Warnings:

         -   Do not change any numeric assignments.
         -   Changes to this list should only be made if there is a compelling
             need that can't be satisfied in another way.  Such changes
             must be approved by at least two OWNERS.
         -   These error codes must match gRPC and protobuf error codes (except for
             DO_NOT_USE_RESERVED_FOR_FUTURE_EXPANSION_USE_DEFAULT_IN_SWITCH_INSTEAD_).

         Sometimes multiple error codes may apply.  Services should return
         the most specific error code that applies.  For example, prefer
         OUT_OF_RANGE over FAILED_PRECONDITION if both codes apply.
         Similarly prefer NOT_FOUND or ALREADY_EXISTS over FAILED_PRECONDITION.

            The Tensor objects fed in the callable and fetched from the callable
             are expected to be backed by host (CPU) memory by default.

             The options below allow changing that - feeding tensors backed by
             device memory, or returning tensors that are backed by device memory.

             The maps below map the name of a feed/fetch tensor (which appears in
             'feed' or 'fetch' fields above), to the fully qualified name of the device
             owning the memory backing the contents of the tensor.

             For example, creating a callable with the following options:

             CallableOptions {
               feed: "a:0"
               feed: "b:0"

               fetch: "x:0"
               fetch: "y:0"

               feed_devices: {
                 "a:0": "/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:GPU:0"
               }

               fetch_devices: {
                 "y:0": "/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:GPU:0"
              }
             }

             means that the Callable expects:
             - The first argument ("a:0") is a Tensor backed by GPU memory.
             - The second argument ("b:0") is a Tensor backed by host memory.
             and of its return values:
             - The first output ("x:0") will be backed by host memory.
             - The second output ("y:0") will be backed by GPU memory.

             FEEDS:
             It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the memory of the fed
             tensors will be correctly initialized and synchronized before it is
             accessed by operations executed during the call to Session::RunCallable().

             This is typically ensured by using the TensorFlow memory allocators
             (Device::GetAllocator()) to create the Tensor to be fed.

             Alternatively, for CUDA-enabled GPU devices, this typically means that the
             operation that produced the contents of the tensor has completed, i.e., the
             CUDA stream has been synchronized (e.g., via cuCtxSynchronize() or
             cuStreamSynchronize()).

            By default, RunCallable() will synchronize the GPU stream before returning
             fetched tensors on a GPU device, to ensure that the values in those tensors
             have been produced. This simplifies interacting with the tensors, but
             potentially incurs a performance hit.

             If this options is set to true, the caller is responsible for ensuring
             that the values in the fetched tensors have been produced before they are
             used. The caller can do this by invoking `Device::Sync()` on the underlying
             device(s), or by feeding the tensors back to the same Session using
             `feed_devices` with the same corresponding device name.

             If you create an ordinary session, e.g., from Python or C++,
             then there is exactly one intra op thread pool per process.
             The first session created determines the number of threads in this pool.
             All subsequent sessions reuse/share this one global pool.

             There are notable exceptions to the default behavior described above:
             1. There is an environment variable  for overriding this thread pool,
                named TF_OVERRIDE_GLOBAL_THREADPOOL.
             2. When connecting to a server, such as a remote `tf.train.Server`
                instance, then this option will be ignored altogether.

             held by a TF server.

             When ClusterSpec propagation is enabled, the value of
             isolate_session_state is ignored when deciding whether to share session
             states in a TF server (for backwards compatibility reasons).
             - If share_session_state_in_clusterspec_propagation is true, the session
             states are shared.
             - If share_session_state_in_clusterspec_propagation is false, session
             states are isolated.

             When clusterspec propagation is not used, the value of
             share_session_state_in_clusterspec_propagation is ignored when deciding
             whether to share session states in a TF server.

             This builds on the model of XLA where a subset of the graph is
             encapsulated and attached to a "compile" operation, whose result is fed
             to an "execute" operation. The kernel for these operations is responsible

             If greater than 1.0, uses CUDA unified memory to potentially oversubscribe
             the amount of memory available on the GPU device by using host memory as a
             swap space. Accessing memory not available on the device will be

          description: |-
            A comma-separated list of GPU ids that determines the 'visible'
             to 'virtual' mapping of GPU devices.  For example, if TensorFlow
             can see 8 GPU devices in the process, and one wanted to map
             visible GPU devices 5 and 3 as "/device:GPU:0", and "/device:GPU:1",
             then one would specify this field as "5,3".  This field is similar in
             spirit to the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable, except
             it applies to the visible GPU devices in the process.

             NOTE:
             1. The GPU driver provides the process with the visible GPUs
                in an order which is not guaranteed to have any correlation to
                the *physical* GPU id in the machine.  This field is used for
                remapping "visible" to "virtual", which means this operates only
                after the process starts.  Users are required to use vendor
                specific mechanisms (e.g., CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES) to control the
                physical to visible device mapping prior to invoking TensorFlow.
             2. In the code, the ids in this list are also called "platform GPU id"s,
                and the 'virtual' ids of GPU devices (i.e. the ids in the device
                name "/device:GPU:<id>") are also called "TF GPU id"s. Please
                refer to third_party/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_id.h
                for more information.

            Force all tensors to be gpu_compatible. On a GPU-enabled TensorFlow,

             allocated as the pinned memory. But in case where the inference is
             incomplete, this option can significantly speed up the cross-device memory
             copy performance as long as it fits the memory.
             Note that this option is not something that should be
             enabled by default for unknown or very large models, since all Cuda pinned
             memory is unpageable, having too much pinned memory might negatively impact
             the overall host system performance.

            Ops are marked as stateful if their behavior depends on some state beyond

      description: |-
        Reset() allows misbehaving or slow sessions to be aborted and closed, and
         causes their resources eventually to be released.  Reset() does not wait
         for the computations in old sessions to cease; it merely starts the
         process of tearing them down.  However, if a new session is started after
         a Reset(), the new session is isolated from changes that old sessions
         (started prior to the Reset()) may continue to make to resources, provided
         all those resources are in containers listed in "containers".

         Old sessions may continue to have side-effects on resources not in
         containers listed in "containers", and thus may affect future
         sessions' results in ways that are hard to predict.  Thus, if well-defined
         behavior is desired, is it recommended that all containers be listed in
         "containers".  Similarly, if a device_filter is specified, results may be
         hard to predict.
